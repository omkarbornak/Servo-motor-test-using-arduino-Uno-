Two Continuous Rotation Servo Motors Test with Arduino Uno
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to control two continuous rotation servo motors using an Arduino Uno. The aim is to independently manage the horizontal and vertical servos to achieve full 360-degree rotations in both directions with precise speed and control.

Components Used:-
Arduino Uno: The microcontroller used for programming and controlling the servos.
Continuous Rotation Servo Motors (x2): Used for controlling horizontal and vertical movement.
Jumper Wires: For connecting components.
Breadboard (optional): For organized wiring.
